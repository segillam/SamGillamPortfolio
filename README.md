## Description

I built this website because I wanted to flex my skills as a developer. Right now this website is mainly a placeholder, but in the future it will display information on all of the projects that I have completed, and will be a spot that I can direct recruiters who need an idea of my qualifications.

## Installation

To view my website, users simply have to go to the url:

They can scroll down and view all the information, or they can click buttons at the top to be directed to specific sections automatically.

## Usage

To use my site, either scroll to browse or click the buttons at the top of the screen to be directed to specific sections automatically.
